This time of year makes one want to look back over the past year. Here I reflect on what has happened at work and the personal front.

# Work

I'm still at the company I joined [last year](http://mikkelhartmann.dk/in-review/2017/12/27/2017-in-review.html). The assignment I was originally hired to work on (predicting severe cardiac events) failed. That meant that I had to figure out what else we could do with the our data. So naturally, this year has included a lot of data mugging and generally just looking or other interesting things to work on within the company.

By the end of last year I had just finished setting up our Data Warehouse -- a process that included _a lot_ of data cleaning. So I'm sure that past Mikkel would be surprised to learn that current Mikkel still has not put any machine learning into production at work. And this is despite the fact I've given a presentation on [building and shipping machine learning products](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vak1wV9jNJI) at a conference in France this year.

There are several reasons for this failure. The first reason is that we simply did not have a particularly good use case -- the models I had been building simply did not perform well enough. Once we got something actually worked (Ill explain what below) the act of actually getting it into production also proved quite difficult. This is hardly surprising, everyone says that building the models is the easy part.

The product is a tool for exploring electrocardiograms, which I have described [here](https://rehfeldmedical.github.io/jekyll/update/2018/10/19/analysing-beats.html). I really like working on this product because it brings a lot of my interests together: The data is similar to some of the stuff I worked on during my Ph.d. -- its a time-series measurement of a voltage. The analysis requires an interesting mixture of classical signal processing and machine learning. The final product is very visual -- one of the things I like the most about doing my Ph.d. was the work on the pretty figures. Finally, when the tool enters production I will have build a machine learning system where I have developed every stage of the pipeline -- from raw data to the final interactive visualization. I'm very proud of this, it is something I have been wanting to do ever since I switched away from academia.

We closed a round of funding which means that I have been in charge of hiring a data science colleague. The hiring process was very time consuming: Writing the job application, shifting through the incoming application, interviewing. This was a full-time job for about three weeks and I'm glad I put a lot of effort into it. The process has been very educational.

I'm very excited about this. So far I have been working with students and I really enjoy teaching this stuff and having someone to discuss problems with. However, there is only so much that can be done in 3-4 months. Getting an experienced colleague who will have the time to dive deeply into some of the challenges we face will benefit the company greatly.

# Personal

I got married! Planning a wedding is exhausting, but I am glad that we did it and I enjoy calling Lise my wife.

We took over our new apartment March this year after an intolerable six months of waiting. The new apartment is great and we really enjoy being closer to the city.

One of my goals for this year was to travel abroad three time with my wife. We went to France, Israel and Norway. The plan succeeded despite the fact that we opted to explore Denmark during our summer holidays, which also gave us some more time to work on the apartment.

I feel like my general programming skills have improved a lot over the last six months. I'm very happy about this and hope to improve further next year. I have been playing around a lot with D3.js in my spare time, and I'm really enjoying it.

On a seemingly boring note I have revived my retirement saving plan. While the act of setting aside money for requirement is boring and slightly annoying, the reflections the act inspires are interesting. You have to think about the live you want to live in 35-40 years time. 

# Next year

Next year I hope to:
1. Get the electrocardiogram analyzer into production.
1. Write 5 blogposts. I find that I like writing about the things I'm learning about and it gives me an excuse to practice D3.js.
1. Finish major renovation project so the apartment is ready for the summer. 
1. Get my mortage down to 200k dkk.
1. 

My wife and I are discussing a lot what do to in the next 1-3 year. We have considered going to Greenland for a couple of months, since they need doctors. It would be fun to live abroad together.

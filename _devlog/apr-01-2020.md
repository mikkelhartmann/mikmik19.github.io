The game is coming along. It is actually looking really well. Buying a bunch of low-poly assets was a great choice. I've added the beginning of an inventory system. Still can't equip things. I'm struggling with the animations and I think I finally understand why. The whole thing is build around Unity's Mechanim system, which is supposed to make triggering animation approachable, even for non-programmers. It makes it almost impossible to work with as a programmer though. 

Aparrently there is another system that can be used, but porting over from Machanim will be so much work I can't even imagine. It is really slowing down my work though. I feel like I can't do any changes to animation related things. It makes it hard to improve the feel of combat. I really should get this thing fixed at some point.

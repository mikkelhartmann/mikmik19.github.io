            <h1> Strings, Arrays and Matrices</h1>
            <p>
              My first experience with programming was using MatLab to do data
              analysis for physics reports in school and later in my Ph.d. It is also
              pretty much my only experience with programming other than brief
              brief periods of using Octave and R. So recently I decided
              to learn Python.

              In using Python to write machile learning algortihms I ran into
              several problems because I did not properly understand
              the differs structures supplied by Python and Numpy package. The
              differences and similarities between Python Lists, Numpy arrays and
              Numpy Matrices got me confused. In this post I attempt to clarify the
              differences.
            </p>
            <h2> Strings </h2>
            <p>
            So first up we have the list. So lets create a list and call it myList:
<pre class="prettyprint">
>>> myList = [‘a’,’b’,’c']
</pre>
            myList is a list containing the elements a, b, c. In this list the elements
            are strings, but i could be numbers. List of numbers have caused
            quite some confusion for me, because they look like vectors.

<!--            Another thing is how one can append of remove things easily.
<pre class="prettyprint">
>>> myList.append(‘d’)
</pre> will append the
            string "d" to the list. If I want to remove an element I simply
            type
<pre class="prettyprint">
>>> myList.remove(‘a’)
</pre>
            and I remove the element ‘a’ from the list.
-->
            List of numbers might be useful, but they are not vectors. If I have
            the list
<pre class="prettyprint">
A = [1,2]
</pre>
            Typing A+1 will get you into trouble:
<pre class="prettyprint">
>>> A+1
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: can only concatenate list (not "int") to list
</pre>
            This is becuse a string is not a vector and the + operator works
            differntly with strings that what you would expect for vectors. So
            we need a way to get vectors.

            <h2> Numpy arrays</h2>
            One way to get vectors in Python is to use the Numpy package. Now, if
            you want to get the vector A = [1 2] you have to use the functions
            that Numpy gives you. So lets import the Numpy package.
<pre class="prettyprint">
>>> import numpy as np
</pre>
            To create the vector A mentioned above one would have to type
<pre class="prettyprint">
>>> A = np.array([1,2])
</pre>
            So you are
            giving a python list of numbers to the array function. This will give
            you the array structure
<pre class="prettyprint">
>>> array([1,2])
</pre>
            and this works like vectors should. if you type
<pre class="prettyprint">
>>> A*2
array([2,4])
</pre>
            you get an array and you can do all the stuff you usually do with
            vectors.

            If I want to access the first element of the vector I type A[0] which
            in this case would give me back 1.

            So you get vectors by feeding a list of numbers to the Numpy .array
            function. If you want a a 3 by 3 matrix you have to supply a list of
            lists, like so:
<pre class="prettyprint">
>>> C = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]])
</pre>
            <h2> Numpy matrices </h2>
            An alternative to creating the multidimensional arrays is to create a matrix
            using the .matrix function. E.g.
<pre class="prettyprint">
>>> a = np.matrix([[1, 2],[ 3 4]])
</pre>
            with this function you can also feed it another kind of string
<pre class="prettyprint">
>>> a = np.matrix('1 2; 3 4')
</pre>
            For MatLab using this syntax will be more familiar. But I prefer to give a
            list of strings so the syntax stays consistent across the differnt types.

            The difference between a 2-dimensional array created using the numpy.array function
            and the .matrix function is that the matrix is a special kind of two dimensional
            array. The matrix structure retains its 2-D nature through operations. It has
            certain special operators, such as * (matrix multiplication) and ** (matrix power).

<!--            <h2> Neat tricks </h2>
            But you can do a lot of other stuff that you could not do with lists.

            Something I quite like about lists in Python is the convenient way
            of looping through the elements of the list. E.g. the code
<pre class="prettyprint">
>>> for x in myList:
...   print(x)
...
a
b
c
</pre>
          We can still use the cool looping technique from before, so if we write
<pre class="prettyprint">
>>> for i in C:
>>>   print(i)
</pre>
          it will print out each row of the matrix.
          One function I particularly like is the .where function. Say we want to find all
          the elements in the Matrix C where the value is above some threshold, T. Then
          we would write
<pre class="prettyprint">
>>> n,m = numpy.where(C>T). If we use T = 3
</pre>
          we would get
<pre class="prettyprint">
>>> n = array([1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2])
</pre>
and
<pre class="prettyprint">
>>> m =  array([0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]).
</pre>
        If we now want to change those values to zero we can simply type
<pre class="prettyprint">
C[n,m] = 0
</pre>
        Pretty neat if you ask me.

        <h2> Summary </h2>
        <p>
          I've compiled a summary table of how the structures react to different
          operations:
        </p>
        <table style="width:100%">
          <tr>
            <th></th>
            <th>List</th>
            <th>Numpy Array</th>
            <th>Numpy Matrix</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Generation:</td>
            <td>A = ['1','2','3']</td>
            <td>A = np.array(['1','2','3'])</td>
            <td>A = np.matrix(['1','2','3'])</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Addition:</td>
            <td>A+1 produces an error</td>
            <td>A+1 = array([2,3,4])</td>
            <td>A+1 = matrix([2,3,4])</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Scalar product:</td>
            <td>A*2 = ['1','2','3','1','2','3']</td>
            <td>A*2 = array([2,4,6])</td>
            <td>A*2 = matrix([2,4,6])</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Dot product:</td>
            <td>A*2 produces an error</td>
            <td>dot(A,A) = array([2,4,6])</td>
            <td>A*A = matrix([2,4,6])</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
          So there is definitely some ambiguity built into the system, but for me
          the takeaway is that I should probably just use the .matrix function
          whenever I want to work with vectors.

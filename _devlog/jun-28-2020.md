This week hasn't been very productive in terms of game development.

I spent most of yesterday being slighly hungover and playing videogames. A new season of HoTS started and Antoine and I got placed in diamond. Today Lise and I went to a preparation course for when Lise will give birth. It was a great course and we learned a lot. We blieve that we have found the birth position that will work out for Lise and I learned how to give massage using a special piece of cloth called a Rebozo. The idea is that is loosensen of the parts of hear that need to be loose at the time of birth. It feels great to participate in the preparations.

I did managed to implement a knock-back effect when enemies are hit. This makes combat, and espically kills feel much more dynaic. Currently the enmies turn completely static on kill, so it doesn't look too great. If I turn them into ragdolls on kill it would look a lot greater.

I hope to get in a few evenings of programming during the week. Getting work done in the weekend is great, but it would be nice with more smaller pushes forward.

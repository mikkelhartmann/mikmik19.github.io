It's time for the annual retrospective. 2020 has been a crazy year and I’m not even thinking about the pandemic, the forest fires, or the US election. Let's go over the major events in my personal and work life.

# Work

I switched jobs.

# Personal

We moved to Køge. How did it go?

> I'm hoping to go for more walks along the beach and see my older brother more often. If remote work is here to stay I think we will be even happier with the choice.

I set five goals last year. How did it go?

- [x]  I want to establish a forest garden.
- [x]  I would like to establish a habit of winter bathing. 
- [ ]  I would like to learn to use the "cloud" or a remote machine. 
- [ ]  I want to write more blogposts.
- [ ]  I want learn more about CSS and SVG. 


Last year I picked my top five books of the year. I'll do the same this year. The books that have stood out the most are:
1. The Dead Wander in the Dessert
1. The Win Hof Method
1. The Hidden Life of Trees
1. Principles

# Next Year

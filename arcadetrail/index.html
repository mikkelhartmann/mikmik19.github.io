            <h1> Overview of the Arcade Trail Data Base </h1>
            <p> Here we show how the number of games in the Arcade Trail data base has grown since the scrapers started doing their work in May 2015.</p>
            <svg id='Arcade_Trail_Game_Growth' width="600" height="300"/>
            <p> Since most of the games are collected with scrapers that are focusing on newly released and announced games most of the games in the Arcade Trail data base are rather new. The older games have either been added manually or through the link-up with a users steam account </p>
            <svg id='Arcade_Trail_Genre_Distribution' width="600" height="800"/>
            <p> Not all the scraped games come with a complete data set. For example, not all games have a release date. This may be because the a game was added without a release date, but it may simply be because the release date is unknown.</p>
            <p> The content of Arcade trail is curated by the community. We rely on the users to submit games and fill in information about the games. The top ten submitters and contributers are listed below:</p>

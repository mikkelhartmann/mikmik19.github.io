I worked some more on the website for the devlog. I can now include images that look like small polaroids. I think this will be fun in a few months to a year. It means that I will be able to scroll down and see how the game has progressed. I went back and added a few images to the earlier entries to get a feel for how it would work.

In making this I've learned more about the templating language, Liquid, used by Jekyll (the framework I use for my blog). It is really quite nice.

title: "Thoughts on The Effective Executive by Peter F. Drucker"

> A decision has not been made untill prople know:
1. the name of the person accountable for carrying it out;
1. the deadline;
1. the names of the people who will be affected by the decision and therefore have to know about, understand, and approve it -- or at least not be strongly apposed to it -- and 
1. the names of the people who have to be informed of the decision, even if they are not directly affected by it.

I am often unsure if a decision has been made because people are not informed. In a small company many decision affect the entire company and yet, not everyone is told. People are often not told due to negligence rather than malice.

> One needs not know in detail what to do with "human relation" if an accountant, or how to promote a new branded product if an engineer. But one has a responsibility to know at least what these areas are about, whey they are around, and what they are trying to do.

I try to figure out what questions are cummon in that fiels, and how they might go about answering those questions. I think has given me a lot of valuable lesson that I can take back and apply to my own field.

> A common cause of time-waste is largely under the executive's control and can be eliminate d by him. That is the time of tohers he himself wastes. Effective executives have learned to ask systematically and without coyness: "What do I do that wastes your time without contributing to your effectiveness".

I have been on the recieving end of these kinds of meetings often, and I should try not to do the same. The monthly one-on-one meetings could be a good way to ask about this "How have I wasted your time since last meeting" or "what has been the greatest waste of time since last meeting, and can I do anything to help?"

> a well-managed orginazation is a "dull" organization. The "dramatic" things in such an organization are basic decisions that make the future, rather than heroics in moppin up yesterday.

> Too many meetings always bespeak poor sturcture of jobs and the wrong organizational components. Too many meetings signify that work that should be in one job or in one component is spread over several jobs or several components. They signify that responisbility is diffused and that infomration is not addressed to the people who need it.

Recently I had to learn Tableau at work. This is a list of links that I found particularly interesting during the learning process.

Kirill Eremenko's coursed on Udemy was very helpful and to the point. I played along with my own data on the side and within a few hours I felt like I had the hang of Tableau. I recommend them all.
1. [Tableau 10 A-Z: Hands-On Tableau Training For Data Science!](https://www.udemy.com/tableau10/)
1. [Tableau 10 Advanced Training: Master Tableau in Data Science](https://www.udemy.com/tableau10-advanced/)
1. [Tableau Expert: Top Visualization Techniques in Tableau 10](https://www.udemy.com/mastering-top-visualization-techniques-in-tableau/)

Bought at the full price this would be very expensive. But Udemy regularly have sales and you should be able to pick up all three courses for a total of about 30 euros, which is extremely cheap.

There are many people who blog about Tableau, below I list a few that I have found interesting
* [Jonathan Drummey's](http://drawingwithnumbers.artisart.org/) blog has a Tableau Wiki section which includes an impressive number of links covering different (all?) concepts in Tableau.
* [Andy Kriebel's](http://www.vizwiz.com/) blog contains some fun weekly topics: Makeover monday, tableau tips tuesday, and workout wednesday.
* [Steve wexler's](http://www.datarevelations.com/about-2) company site has insights on visualizing survey data.

Other interesting links
* [Tableau zen-master.](https://www.tableau.com/zen-masters) Tableau maintains a list of people who are particularly good at engaging with the community. They get the title of Tableau Zen master. This site contains a complete list of current and former Zen Masters.
* [Interwork's blog](https://www.interworks.com/blog) includes more than 200 blog posts.

Books that I find interesting
* [Big book of dashboards.](http://www.bigbookofdashboards.com/) Having learned how to make dashboards in Tableau its time to learn how to make *good* dashbaords. The application to health care is particularly interesting for me.
* [Tableau for Healthcare, Third Edition.](https://www.amazon.com/Tableau-Healthcare-Third-Daniel-Benevento/dp/0692938508/ref=pd_sim_14_10?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=NBKMEQQSRWJSSF4XADHG) Since I work in the healthcare sector, this book should be particularly interesting.

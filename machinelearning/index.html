            <h1> Learning Machine Learning </h1>
            <h2> Introduction </h2>
            <p>So first a bit about myself. Im 26 year old. I’m currently a Ph.d.
              student in experimental physics and I have a master’s degree in
              mathematica and physics from the University at Roskilde. While I use
              MatLab every day for controlling experiments, analysing data and
              making pretty figures, I have had no formal training in any programming
              language. All I know about MatLab I know though using the “help X”
              function in MatLab or through Googling “How to X in MatLab”. Over
              the last three years I have become quite efficient in MatLab, but
              I often run into problems where my fundamental knowledge about
              programming languages become dauntingly obvious.</p>

              <p>So before starting this Machine Learning project I had a firm understanding
              of mathematics and experience with numerical programming.</p>

              <p>In the beginning of January 2016 I decided to follow Coursera's
              Machine Learning course taught by Andrew Ng.</p>
            <h2> A walkthough of the collaberative filtering method </h2>
            <p> In this blog post we will implement a machine learning algorithm
              to recommend games to users based on the game they like owe and like.
              The data is from www.arcadetrail.com — check it out, its awesome.</p>

            <p> Technically, the type of recommender system we will implement is
              called collaborative filtering. We will construct at Matrix with the
              shape \( (# users)x(# games) \). This matrix
              contains all the votes and game ownerships for each user. The matrix
              is incomplete in the sense that not every user will have voted for
              every game. The aim is to establish which games a user might like,
              that is, we will fill out the missing parts of the \(R\) matrix.
              $$ \theta X = R^* $$
              We do this by finding the matrixes \( X \) and \( \Theta \)  whose
              inner product gives the filled out matrix \( R^* \).

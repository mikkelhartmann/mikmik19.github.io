I spent a few hours this evening setting up a sit fore these journal notes. Doesn't really progress the game, but I wanted to some light work that was vaugely related to the game. The site is just a list of journal entries, but each entry has its own paper-like look. I think it's cute and it does give an added sense of pregression. 

In the future I would like to be able to add little screenshots of the game -- perhaps they should look like polaroids. It shouldn't take away too much time from actually developing the game. But I had some fun with it, so I guess that is allright.

Now I really should get back to that particle effect on collission I mentioned about 2 weeks ago...

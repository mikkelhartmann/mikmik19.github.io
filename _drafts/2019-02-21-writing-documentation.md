I've been writing a lot of documentation at work. I like think kind of work but I find it quite difficult.

There are two questions I had:
1. The question of style. How verbose should the text be? What are common phrases? How do I make it _read_ like documentaion.
1. The question of tooling. How do I build documentation that is easy to maintain?

To answer these question I have been leaning heavily on the documentation of the python modules that I use daily like `numpy` and `scipy`. Reading the documentaion helps me get a feel for what and how 

I wanted to dig deeper and learn more about writing good documentation. Gennerally I'm of the impression that if you spend a long time doing something you might as well do it well and hone your skill.

Below I've included a list on the most noteworthy sources that I have come across in my research.

## Articles

* [A beginnerâ€™s guide to writing documentation](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/writing/beginners-guide-to-docs/) This is a short motivational write up that explains why you should write good documentation. It has some good examples to projects that do a good job at documentation. This is part of a a broader [Documentaion Guide](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/).


## Books

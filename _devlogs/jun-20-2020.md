I got started on the ability system. I want to add a rough outline of all the systems I want in the game. I really want combat to be engaging and chalanging.

I started this journal because I've been reading "The Making of Prince of Persia: Journals 1985-1993" by Jordan Mechner. It is so good! Reminds me of Masters of Doom, even though the format coudln't be more different. Seeing how his mood and motivation swings reminds me of my time spent doing my Ph.D. It took him three years to finish the game, so the time horizon is even similar. Anyway, he had a 8 month period where he didn't work on the game because he was writing and pitching a manuscript. All of a sudden I don't feel so bad about the 2 months I didn't work on my game.

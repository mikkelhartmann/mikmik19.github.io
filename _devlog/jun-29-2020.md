I should remember that the main goal of this project is to learn how to make video games and not a get rich scheme. When I get stuck I should see it as good oppotunity to learn something new, not a stumbling block on my road to riches.

I managed to program for 2 hours today after dinner. I got the ragdoll effect on kill working, and squashed a bug or two. If I can keep this up over the summer I should have a game that can be played though. This would require that I 

1. implement a basic savings system, 
1. a boss, and 
1. some sort of reward progression system. 

This would be a huge milestone. But still, the main goal should be to make combat feel rewarding.

Tomorrow I hope to implement a particle effect when the weapon collides with the enemy. This should make the combat come alive even more.

It was very useful for me as a first introduction to Object-Oriented Programming. I now feel more prepared to dive into more specialised books about programming.<br/><br/>I will give you a brief overview of my background, so you understand my context going into this book. I have a master's degree in physics and mathematics and a Ph.d. in experimental physics. During my time at the university, I used MatLab for data analysis and plotting. I was never taught MatLab, but was expected to lean as needed. After finishing the ph.d. I got a job in a small start-up as a machine learning engineer. I had prepared for such a position by taking courses on Coursera and playing around with Python and its modules for Data Science and Machine Learning. Still only focusing on analysis.<br/><br/>So most of my code tended to live in single files and I had never felt the need to create a class.<br/><br/>I started reading this book because I wanted to have a better understanding of the systems that will be using my analyses.<br/><br/>This book is very long. However, I think the author has succeeded in writing a very readable book, which makes it possible to read it from cover to cover in a relatively short time span (I read it in a month). I generally enjoy reading, so this was not a problem for me, but if you are in a hurry, this might not be the book for you.<br/><br/>The book is well structured, so if you are more familiar with the general concepts than I was, you can probably skip quite a lot. If you are not familiar with the concepts, the author has you back and gives several examples and explain the concepts at length. Each chapter contains check-lists at the end, which served as useful summaries, but should also work quite well as a tool for skimming the different chapters.<br/><br/>The code snippets in this book are in C++, Java, and Visual Basic. I knew none of these languages, but this was not a problem because it his points apply to writing object-oriented code in general.<br/><br/>This book focuses on the problems that arise when you work on a software projects with tens or hundreds of programmers. I work on a small team (less than 5 people), so I don't experience most of these problems on a day to day basis, but it was interesting to read about none the less.<br/><br/>After having read this book I feel better prepared to dive into other books about good programming style. I have ordered Clean Code by Robert C. Martin and The Practical Programmer by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas. It will be interesting to see how these books compare to Code Complete.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

So reading this book was definitely a good idea.<br/><br/>I especially appreciated the chapters on Numpy and Pandas (~180 pages).

Both chapters also contain advice on how to speed up the code when needed.<br/><br/>Generally, I really liked this book and will definitely add it to our library at work so I can reference it and lend it to our students and interns.

My background is in mathematics and physics and I always enjoyed reading about the histories of these fields, so I wanted something similar for computer science. I hoped to get two things out of reading this book: 1) A better understanding of the historical development of the field and 2) inspiration for other intersting works or books to look into. <br/><br/>I think this books delivers reasonably on both fronts, especially considering the short length.<br/><br/>I now have a better understanding of the history of some of the programming languages like FORTAN and Lisp. The book also peaked my interesting to getting closer to the knots and bolts of algorithms in general, so I have decided to give Donald Knuth's The Art of Computer Programming vol. 1 a try. I had considered it before, but this book tipped the scale.<br/><br/><br/><br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

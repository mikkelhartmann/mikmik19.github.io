I'm a Data Scientist at <a href="https://makewise.io">MakeWise</a> where I work on a clinical decision support system. Before that I studied physics and mathematics at the University of Roskilde in Denmark.

My studies culminated in a Ph.D. in experimental physics from Roskilde University and Laboratoire LÃ©on Brillouin, a lab just outside of Paris, France. My thesis was on the structure and dynamics of hydrogen-bonded liquids. While these system are interesting from both an experimental and theoretical points of view, by the end of the day I didn't care much about what the molecules were actually doing. So I needed to work on something else. It also occurred to me that while I liked the heavy analysis of data, I didn't particularly like carrying out the experiments. You can imagine that this is a deal-breaker for an experimental physicist.

So I knew that I needed to try something else even before I finished my Ph.D. Luckily data science and machine learning were all the rage at the time, so I studied it in my spare time and was able to land a job after defending my thesis.

I started this blog because I find it useful to write about topics while learning about them. I also wanted a place to write the occasional summary of my side projects because sometimes linking to a Jupyter Notebook can be a bit underwhelming.

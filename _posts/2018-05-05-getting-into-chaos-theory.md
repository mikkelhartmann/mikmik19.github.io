Recently I had to learn about Chaos Theory at work. This is a list of links that I found particularly interesting during the learning process.

Popular science books on the subject:
1. [Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order by Steven H. Strogatz](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/354421.Sync). This is the book that got me interested in the subject to begin with. It is well written and leave you wanting more. Luckily the auther has also written a text-book on the subject, which is whole heartedly reccoment as well (see below).
1. [Chaos: Making a New Science](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39342399-chaos). This book has a broader focus than Synch, and tells the story of how the study of chaotic systems became a science.
1. [Complexity: A Guided Tour by Melanie Mitchell](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5597902-complexity?ac=1&from_search=true) This book has a broader focus than Synch, and it gives

If any of the books above peaked your interest in the study of non-linear dynamics, the books below will give you a more thorough

text-books on the subsect:
1. [Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos: With Applications to Physics, Biology, Chemistry, and Engineering](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/116164.Nonlinear_Dynamics_and_Chaos). This book is amazing. The author states in the beginning that the book will be

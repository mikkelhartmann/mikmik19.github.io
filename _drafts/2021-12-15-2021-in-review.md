It's time for the annual retrospective. Let's go over the major events in my personal and work life.

# Work

I left my position as Head of Data Science at Vital Beats. It was my first job outside University, my first data science position, my first Start-Up experience, and my first management position. I stayed for four years and learned a tremendous amount and got to do important work with nice people.

I also felt that I was growing apart from the company. We had a large hiring round and great emphasis was put on candidate being "culture fits" -- well, increasingly, I was feeling I wouldn't pass that filter. I think this is quite natural when staying with a start-up for several years, and we ended things on a good note. I hope Vital Beat succedes, they deserve it.

My main reason for leaving Vital Beats was my move to Køge. I absolutely didn't want to do the 80 minutes commute to Copenhagen each day. I Handed in my resignation as I went on paternaty leave. There is never a good time to quit, but I felt that the timing was as good as it was going to get. I made three great decision this year, and deciding to Vital Beats was one of them. 

Starting a five months paternity leave without a job wasn't such a great idea. I ended up stressing quite a bit about finding a new job. It ended well, but if I'm lucky enough to go on another paternity leave I'd like to have everything sorted out -- it is just one less thing to worry about.

I'm now a Senior Data Scientist with Musopia, a company that build apps that help people learn to play guitar and ukulele. I'm part of a small three person analytics team. It is the first time I work for a business-to-consumer company so there are lots concepts for me to learn: conversion rates, average revenue per new user, monthly recurring revenue, stuff like that. In the first six months I've set up a platform for AB-test reporting, build a few dashboards in Tableau, and worked on building up our backend with dbt. The next six months I think I'll get to work on porting Tableau dashboards to Cube.js/React and doing some analysis of driving factors for churn etc.  

I'm exclusively building tools that are used within the company. This is great because it means that I have very easy access to my end users. This is very different from MedTech where patient and doctors can be hard to get access to.

The position is fully remote and I absolutely love it. It gives me some much needed flexibility. I can use the lille breaks during the workday to get some housework done.  If my daughter gets called home I can pick her up within 10 minutes and shift my work to the evening if neccessary. It turns out that kids get sick all the time. I remember reading that in Sweden they have 60 days of paid kid-sick-leave for parents and thinking: "two months!? are all kids in Sweden cronically ill?" now I'm thinking it sounds about right. Getting a remote posisition was my second great decision of 2021.

# Personal

We moved to Køge in March. In my 2020 review I wrote:

> I'm hoping to go for more walks along the beach and see my older brother more often. If remote work is here to stay I think we will be even happier with the choice.

So did it live up to my hopes? I don't go to the beach all that often, but I do see my brother more. 

I set five goals last year. How did it go?

- [x]  I want to establish a forest garden. I did. I haven't harvested anything yet since the plants need a year to settle down.
- [x]  I would like to establish a habit of winter bathing. This is the third great choice of 2021. Winter bathing is absolutely amazing and since I work remotely I can do it during my lunch breaks. It is a piece of everyday luxery. I've established a weekly sauna/lunch date with my older brother so it also means that we see more to each other.  
- [ ]  I would like to learn to use the "cloud" or a remote machine. I'm not quite sure exactly what I had in mind here, but I think it was stuff like SSH'ing into a machine and doing work there. I don't think I actually need to "learn" this. The tools are getting so good that you won't really know that you are doing it. I'm using BigQuery daily without thinking about it. I've also used GitPod for a personal project. They fire us everything on a machine somewhere and it works seamlessly.   
- [ ]  I want to write more blogposts. I didn't and I'm not sure that I want to have 'quantity of blogposts' as a goal for 2022. I still enjoy blogging, but I haven't done it so much this year. It seems that I publish 4-6 each year and that's fine.
- [ ]  I want learn more about CSS and SVG. I haven't really focused on this. Perhaps next year.


Last year I picked my top five books of the year. I'll do the same this year. The books that have stood out the most are:
1. The Dead Wander in the Dessert
1. The Win Hof Method
1. The Hidden Life of Trees
1. Principles

# Next Year

1. Eat at least meal that primarely uses ingredients from my forest garden.
1. Port my blog to a React based framework. This blog has always been my training ground for learning Web technoliges. I'd love to get more exerpeince with React and porting this blog seems like a reasonable step.
1.

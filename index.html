        I am a 20 something physicists trying to learn machine learning. When I
        am faced with a difficult problem I find it usefull to write a text
        about it. This is where I keep these texts. They are mostly here so future
        Mikkel can find them easily but feel free to read along.

    <h2> Learning Python </h2>
    <p>
      <a href="http://mikkelhartmann.dk/learningPython/">Lists and Vectors</a>:
      I have been running into trouble while implementing machine learning
      algorithms in python -- not because the math is giving me a hard time, but
      because I unintentionally mix up the different structures that Python and
      the Numpy package provide. In this post I attempt to clear the waters.
    </p>
    <h2> Machine Learning - Reccomender systems </h2>
    <p>
      One of my favortie features of Spotify, Steam and Goodreads is the reccomendations
      they provide. So I've decided the write a reccomender system for video games.

      <a href="http://mikkelhartmann.dk/collaberativeFilteringMath/">Collaberative Filtering
        - The mathematics</a>: Before writing any code one should first understand the
        algorithm and the mathematics behind it. This post is all about the mathematics.
    </p>

      <a href="http://mikkelhartmann.dk/collaberativeFilteringPython/">Collaberative Filtering
        - Writing it in python</a>: While the level of abstraction mathamatics
        providde is great any implementation often raises several issues. In this
        post I go through the particular implementation I have written in Python.

      <a href="http://mikkelhartmann.dk/collaberativeFilteringTesting/">Collaberative Filtering
        - Testing the model</a>: Once you have a working system it needs to be
        tested. This take a lot of work and in many ways this is where it gets
        interesting -- how can you tweak the parameter to make it preform better?
        Is is baiased in any way? These are the kinds of questions that I address
        in this post.

I finished up the ability system with cooldowns and everything. I started work on knockback on hitting enmies. I want the combat to have more oomph, and I think this will be a step in the right direction. 

I've been thinking about making other games too. I can't wait until I become more familiar with Unity so game development becomes a creative process rather than a slow tool-learning process. I'm getting more convinced that I want to move my professional life closer to the gaming industry.

I'm not feeling very motivated about my day-time job at the moment. This is despite the fact that we are about to enter a high growth period. I should be excited about this and the team I get to buid. I'm not though. I'm mostly hoping that I can cash out soon. That won't happen though. That will take at least 2-5 more years. Is it worth it?

I'm spending all my weekends on this thing. A made a couple of false starts, but I finally feel like I've founds a solution that works. I'll buy all the artwork, audio, and assets -- long live Unity Asset store. I've set a limit of 3.000 dkk for the entire project.

I applied for a job as Senior Data Scientist at Unity. Didn't make it past the first interview. It's a shame, because it means that I never got past the recruiter -- no chance to discuss what the work would actually entail. All I got from the recruiter is that it is a very broad role. So could be anything, really. The whole process stress me out. I don't like interviewer when I'm already employeed. I am more ready to leave my company than I thought though.

I live in a section of Frederiksberg called Dormus Vistas Parken III. It is a collection of row houses of two to three stories. They consist of houses and appartments, form now on we will refer to each as a unit. 

Generally the house are 120 m2 or 150m2. The apparment I live in is 62 m2, anre there about about five of those.



Let's look at how the price per square meter has changed since 2000. The radius of the circles indicate the square meeter of the unit.

This time of year makes one want to look back over the past year. Here I reflect on what has happened on work and the personal front.

# Work

I'm still at the company I joined [last year](http://mikkelhartmann.dk/in-review/2017/12/27/2017-in-review.html). The assigment I was originally hired to work on (predicting seveer cardiac events) failed. This year has included a lot of data mugging and generally just looking or other interesting things to work on within the company. 

By the end of last year I had just finshed setting out our Data Warehouse, which had included _a lot_ of data cleaning. So I'm sure that past Mikkel would be surprised to learn that current Mikkel still has not put any machine learning into production at work. And this is despite the fast I've given a presentation on putting machine learning in production.

There are several reasons for this failure. The first reaons is that we simply did not have a particularly good use case -- the models I had been building simply did not perform well enough. Once we got something actually worked (Ill explain what below) the act of actually getting it into production proved quite difficult. This is hardly surprising, everyone says that building the models is the easy part.

I've gotten the chance to work on some D3.js code, wich will eventually get into producting. When that happens I will have build a machine learning system where I have developed every stage of the pipeline -- from raw data to the final interactive visualization. Thats a pretty great achievement and something that I have been wanting to do ever since I switched away from academia.

The product is a tool for exploring electrocardiograms. I really like working on this product because it brings a lot of things together: The data reminds of some of the stuff I worked on during my ph.d. -- its a timeseries measurement of a voltage. The analysis requires and interesting mixture of classical signal processing and machine learning. The final product is very visual -- one of the things I like the most about doing my Phd was the work on the pretty figures. 

I feel like my general programming skills have improved a lot over the last six months.

Last year I wrote that I would be getting a couple of new colleagues in 2018. This is partly true, but mainly we have just replaced people who left. The funding round that we started last year has taken a long time to close for complicated reasons going back to the inception of the company, five year ago. Hopefully this will be closed soon and we will be able to scale up our staff slightly.

# Personal 

I got married! 

We took over our new appartment March this year after an intolerable six months of waiting. The new appartmen is great and we really enjoy being closer to the city.

One of my goals was to travel abroud three time with my wife. We went to France, Israel and Norway. The plan succeded despite the fact that we opted to explore Denmark during our summer holidays, which also gave us some more time to work on the appartment.

I have been playing around a lot with D3.js in my spare time, and I'm really enjoying it. When I was finishing my Ph.d. and of the options I considered was getting a job in the "industry" where my main reponsobility would be makign pretty graphs, since this was one most enjoyable parts of the ph.d. job. 


# Next year
On the work side I hope next year will be the year where I finally get another full time data science employee. I've been working with students and interns throughout this year and I really enjoy teaching this stuff and having someone to discuss problems with.

On the personal my wife and I are discussing a lot what do to in the next 1-3 year. We have considered going to Greenland for a couple of months, since they need doctors. It would be fun to live abroad together.

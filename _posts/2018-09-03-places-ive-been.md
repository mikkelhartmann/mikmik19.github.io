I've wanted to get a Scratch-It Map for a while. However, I couldn't quite decide on which kind I wanted, or where to place it in the event that I got one. Since I've been getting into D3.js I thought that making my own map would be a good exercise. While this map is not scratchable (yet?), it does serve the purpose of highlight all the places I've visited over the years. I plan to add interactivity and make the map more granular later.

<center><div class="svg-container" id='places-ive-been'></div></center>
<script type='text/javascript'  src='../../../../js/d3/places-ive-been.js'></script>

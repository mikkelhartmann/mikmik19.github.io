It's time for the annual retrospective. Let's go over the major events in my personal and work life.

# Work

I left my position as Head of Data Science at Vital Beats. It was my first job outside University, my first data science position, my first Start-Up experience, and my first management position. I stayed for four years and learned a tremendous amount, got to do important work with nice people, but I also felt that I was growing apart from the company.

Little things started to annoy me. We had a large hiring round and great emphasis was put on candidate being "culture fits" -- well, increasingly, I was feeling I wouldn't pass that filter. I think this is quite natural when staying with a start-up for several years, and we ended things on a good note. I hope Vital Beat succedes, they deserve it.

However, my main reason for leaving was my move to Køge. I absolutely didn't want to commute to Copenhagen each day. 

I decided to hand in my resignation as I went on paternaty leave. There is never a good time to quit, but I felt that the timing was as good as it was going to get.

I made three great decision this year, and decided to say goodbye to Vital Beats was one of them. 

Starting a five months paternity leave without a job wasn't such a great idea. I ended up stressing quite a bit about finding a new job. It ended well, but if I'm lucky enough to go on another paternity leave I'd like to have everything sorted out -- it is just one less thing to worry about.

I'm now a Senior Data Scientist with Musopia, a company that build apps that help people learn to play guitar and ukulele. I'm part of a small three person analytics team. It is the first time I work for a business-to-consumer company so there are a lot of new metrics and concepts for me to learn: conversion rates, average revenue per new user, monthly recurring revenue, stuff like that.

I'm building tools for the company. This is great because it means that I have very easy access to my end users. This is very different from MedTech where patient and doctors can be hard to get access to.

The position is fully remote and I absolutely love it. It gives me some much needed flexibility. It turns out that kids get sick all the time. I remember reading that they have 60 days of paid kid-sick-leave for parents and thinking: "two months!? are all kids in Sweden cronically ill?" now I'm thinking it sounds about right. If my daughter gets called home I can pick her up within 10 minutes and shift my work to the evening if neccessary.

# Personal

We moved to Køge. In my 2020 review I wrote:

> I'm hoping to go for more walks along the beach and see my older brother more often. If remote work is here to stay I think we will be even happier with the choice.

So did it live up to my hopes? 

I set five goals last year. How did it go?

- [x]  I want to establish a forest garden.
- [x]  I would like to establish a habit of winter bathing. 
- [ ]  I would like to learn to use the "cloud" or a remote machine. 
- [ ]  I want to write more blogposts.
- [ ]  I want learn more about CSS and SVG. 


Last year I picked my top five books of the year. I'll do the same this year. The books that have stood out the most are:
1. The Dead Wander in the Dessert
1. The Win Hof Method
1. The Hidden Life of Trees
1. Principles

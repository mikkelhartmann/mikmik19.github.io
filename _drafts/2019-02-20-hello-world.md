I have started going to a local [book club](https://www.meetup.com/CPH-Tech-Books-Film/) on science and tech books. This post was written to collect my thoughts in preparation for the meeting.

The book is about how humans should live with algorithms. In the authors own words:

> It’s about asking if an algorithm is having a net benefit on society. About when you should trust a machine over your own judgement, and when you should resist the temptation to leave machines in control. It’s about breaking open the algorithms and finding their limits; and about looking hard at ourselves and finding our own. About separating the harm from the good and deciding what kind of world we want to live in. Because the future doesn’t just happen. We create it.

My main concern going into this book was that it would simly be a list of examples of algorithms doing wrong, like e.g. [Weapons of Math Destruction](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28186015-weapons-of-math-destruction). While reading one of this kind of books can be nice, reading a second would be a bit much. I wanted this book to suggested ways of solving the problems rather than just another list of problems.

The book didn't dissapoint, but im not overly excited with it either. I like the structure of the book. The chapters are cideded into categories and each category has a couple of examples. The examples set the scene. But I didnt get this book for the examples, I got it for the discussion that the example should facilitate. And unfortionately I think that the discussions sometimes flet flat. Or at least were a lot shorter than they needed to be. Often they would cover 1-2 pages of a 30+ page chapter.

There is one discussion point that I think was quite interesting and its the one about diversity and fairness in the prediction.

But the book did suggest how we should proceed, and I generaly really liked the concluding chapter because it does tackle the main questions directly. For example the final paragraph of the book does a good job of describing her view:

>This is the future I’m hoping for. One where the arrogant, dictatorial algorithms that fill many of these pages are a thing of the past. One where we stop seeing machines as objective masters and start treating them as we would any other source of power. By questioning their decisions; scrutinizing their motives; acknowledging our emotions; demanding to know who stands to benefit; holding them accountable for their mistakes; and refusing to become complacent. I think this is the key to a future where the net overall effect of algorithms is a positive force for society.

Earlier in the same chapter she suggests that we can achieve this if we start to buil algortihms with the aim of making it easier to question their decisions. This can be done by making algorithms give their confidence together with their predictions, or by making the algorithms give several predictions at once.

I think this is something worth striving for, but I know that explainability and confidance estimates are very active research areas.

# Questions for the book club
1. Do you feel better or worse about how algorithms incluence our lives after having read the book?
1. Did this book make you change your mind on any of the topics it covered?

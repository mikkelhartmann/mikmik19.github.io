  TO DO:
  * Give a brief example of what do expect from the algorith. Show a 10x10
    matrice before and after algorithm
  * Compare the algorith to simply taking the average
  * Make a "fact" box in the introduction that explains what the algortihm does
    and doesn't do

            I have not discussed how to select the right values of \( \lambda \)
            let alone how ones tests the quality of the reccomendations. This will
            be the subject of another blog post.

            Building this reccomender system was fun. However, there are a number
            of obvious improvements. For example, I know my older brother is not
            a big fan of first person shooters. Yet, on the list of reccomendations
            for him I find: Counter-Strike, Counter-Strike: Source,
            Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and
            Half-Life 2: Deathmatch. Clearly the reccomender system would really
            like for him to try out Counter Strike. Luckily there is such a thing
            as a  content based reccomender system! I will write about this in
            the future.

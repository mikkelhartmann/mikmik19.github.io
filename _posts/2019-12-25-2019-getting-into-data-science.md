title: "Getting into: Data Science"
---

I have now been a data scientist for over three years now. I started looking into it at least five years ago. 

These are the reference I would recommend to people getting into the field. They are the books and online courses that I have found to be most useful in the long run.

These books are all tool-specific. I use Python and Web technologies to build prototypes. This has been extremely useful because I had to build up a data science team and a big part of the job was to get people excited about the potential. 

1. [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32899495-hands-on-machine-learning-with-scikit-learn-and-tensorflow?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=sgl26Cjg1E&rank=1). This is the best bok I have read on the Python stack for machine learning. It strikes a good balance between theory, practice and code example.
1. [Effective Computation in Physics: Field Guide to Research with Python](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25878970-effective-computation-in-physics). This books cover most of the basics. It teaches you have to use the terminal, Make, and a all the basic python packages for scientific computation in Python. I reccomend is a good allround introduction to the Python stack for Data Science.
1. [D3.js in Action](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22514446-d3-js-in-action?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=mOtGZsi3Am&rank=2) and [Interactive Data Visualization for the Web](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16087610-interactive-data-visualization-for-the-web). It is possible to  get people excite about tables and static graphs if you do the presentation right -- but it is so much easier if you are demoing a fully interactive product. You can show _how_ your results _could_ be used.
1. [Flask Web Development: Developing Web Applications with Python](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18774655-flask-web-development?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=kyXkxaLtC9&rank=4). This book is useful because it allows you to build a functioning prototype of a website.
1. [Clean Code](), [Code Complete]() or [The Pragmatic Programmer](). The general idea here is just to read a book about how to write maintainable code. This is especially important because a lot of data scientists have a background in the natural sciences where the approach to coding is: when it seems to work it is done.

I plan to keep adding to this list as more useful reference emerge.

Got working on the game again. Haven't had it opened since May 3. I finally fixed the problem with Git Large File storage that made me stop working on it. I guess the lesson is that I shouldn't get too bugged down with worflow/process optimization. Workin on the game is the fun part after all, and if you stop for too long you forget.

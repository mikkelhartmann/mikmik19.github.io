As a follow up to my [post on strange attractors](http://mikkelhartmann.dk/2019/03/09/strange-attractors.html) I've decided to take a look at symmetric fractals.

Hovering over the small images will bring them in focus.

        <img id="main_image" src="../../../../assets/img/symmetric-fractals/fractal-0.png" width="70%">
    </div>
    <div id="placeholder"></div>
</center>

The idea for these illustration is taken from te book [Symmetry in Chaos](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2715660-symmetry-in-chaos?ac=1&from_search=true). It includes the math behind them as well as a program written in BASIC to recreate the figures. I've created them in Python using `datashader` for the coloring and `numba` for the calculations.

Next I want to reproduce the figures from the chapter on Quilts â€“ tilings created from symmetric icons.
